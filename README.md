# Hiking-Sweden-Sormlandsleden

This is a collection of [KML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole_Markup_Language) files for a hiking area in the souther part of Sweden, Sörmland, Stockholm - Nyköping - Södertälje - Katrineholm - Eskilstuna - Mariefred.
The files have an origin from https://www.traildino.com/trace/continents-Europe/countries-Sweden and have then been modified for accuracy. 
The official routes are maintained at http://www.sormlandsleden.se/ but aren't available as separate files there, but only as routes plotted on images of maps. 

The files that have been modified and added have been produced by plotting paths in Google Earth. 

Process:
* Run Google Earth locally
* In *My Places*, *Add new* - *Path*
* Name the path descriptively based on the start and end points of the leg. 
* Draw the leg. Keep the leg a normal hiking distance, normally not longer than 15km / 10 miles.
* Export each leg separately, not as a collection, as these files / legs need to be small to be imported in devices like Garmin GPS'es.

## Helping out
If you download and update or add to the files, then please share this with me.
Getting you hands on good KML files aren't always easy, so stick to *Sharing is caring* :p
Also, stick to KML and not KMZ as plain text is easier to work with.

## Disclaimer

This is not an official hiking trail source, but an private effort without any guarantee of the actual data provided. 

Always check your trail with an official map and **never go hiking without an official map on paper**. They tend to have unlimited battery power and will never fail you.
